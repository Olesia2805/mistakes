# 🚀 Using Artificial Intelligence in programming! 🧠

🔍 AI transformed my learning from the usual search for possible information from all over the Internet to the exciting solution of practical problems with just one request.

🧮 For example, after submitting a request to AI "write examples of code with programming errors", I received a task for practice. In these folders you will find sample generated tasks (at the beginning of the file in """ ... """) and my solutions. For me, it helped to understand the basic concepts of programming and to try to solve common problems that one might face.
